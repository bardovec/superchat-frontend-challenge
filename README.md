### `Icons and Theme issue`

In this project i use rerendering of icons and themes that user is choose. This choise sets in localstorage of yours browser. If you share this url to Somebody this somebody does not seen Icon and theme because his localstorage is empty. To resolve this problem we can connect Mongo DB or another DataBase.

Have Fun))
